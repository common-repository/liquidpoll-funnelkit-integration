    Integrate FunnelKit Automations in Liquidpoll plugin.

== Description ==

Integration with FunnelKit Automations to FunnelKit Automations plugin.

By using FunnelKit Automations and LiquidPoll together with this integrator plugin, you can directly onboard users with a poll and get them segmented by their responses into the CRM database according to **tags** and **lists**.

You can tag members or participants based on the following 3 ways or in combination of these:
    1. Option Selected > Add custom tag
    2. Lead Form Submitted > Add custom tag
    3. Lead Form Submitted > Add contact to a list

So the user’s journey is **Respond to poll** > **Complete the form** (Name, Email etc.) > **Submit**

Done! The user would be added to your contact list segment.

**Required Plugins**
    * [LiquidPoll Free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-poll/) or [LiquidPoll PRO](https://www.liquidpoll.com/pro/)
    * [FunnelKit Automations Free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluent-crm/)
    * LiquidPoll – FunnelKit Automations Integration plugin


### How to use?
To transform any poll into a FunnelKit Automations input tool you need to have this integrator plugin installed. Any member or participant who are responding to your poll gets automatically tagged and segmented by this process.

### Polls Connected to Lists & Tags
Any poll you have created can be assigned to a FunnelKit Automations **List** or **Tag**.

Simply go to the **Form** tab of your poll and add the list and tag you want to associate.

### Poll Responses Connected to Tags
Any poll options can also be associated with a tag you have created in FunnelKit Automations.

In the **Options** tab of your poll, simply select the **Tag** against each option.

This integration only works with multi choice polls right now, it does not work with NPS or reaction type polls.
